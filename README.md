# TrafficLightDRL
This project implements adaptive traffic signal control using Deep Reinforcement Learning with SUMO. A DQN-based agent learns optimal traffic light phases to minimize vehicle waiting time and is evaluated against a static fixed-time traffic signal controller to compare AI-based and traditional traffic management performance.
